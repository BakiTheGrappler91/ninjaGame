# Ninja Game

This project is a tutorial walkthrough of a game made by the YouTuber DaFluffyPotato to help me understand game development.  The goal was to get a foundation in game development so I could start building my own games.  Built with the python library Pygame.

## The game itself

A 2D platform game done in a pixel art style where you play as a ninja whose goal is to traverse the level, eliminating all of the enemies in order to progress to the next level.

## Key benefits of this project:
- Building my own physics engine
- Understanding OOP
- File and script organisation
- Understanding game dev concepts e.g. game logic, particle effects, animations
